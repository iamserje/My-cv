### About me:
  I am very interested in programming, create sites. I want to do this professionally. In order for my interest to turn into my profession, and thus, _combine hobbies and work_. There is a proverb: > a person who loves his work has not a single working day! Now in the process of changing the profession I devote the **maximum time to learning and training**. In general, if I set goals, I try to achieve them at all costs.

   I donâ€™t have much experience as such, but if you count the hours and nights  I spent at the computer, solving some interesting problems ( _for example, installing and setting up a new Linux distributiv, setting up a home network of 4 computers, creating a bash script for renaming 1000 catalogs in a working directory, and so on_ ), then it cannot be said that I do not know anything.

   A year ago, I got carried away with programming on Python, went on a course on STEPIK. Now I realized that **Fronted development** is more promising, and deciding to try, I realized that this area was very interesting to me. Intends to study it and become a professional.
